          <p>Hi, I’m Samuel. I’m a software engineer, educator, and entrepreneur who believes that everyone has a unique purpose given by God. I’m passionate about helping people discover their gifts and apply them to create value for themselves and others.</p>
          <p>Through Young Devs Ltd, the company I founded, I work with youth, businesses, and organizations to leverage technology for learning, growth, and solving real-world problems. My vision is to build a community of purpose-driven innovators who approach technology not just as a tool, but as a way to impact lives positively.</p>
          <p>Faith, integrity, and service guide everything I do. I believe true success comes when your work aligns with God’s purpose, uplifts others, and inspires change.</p>
